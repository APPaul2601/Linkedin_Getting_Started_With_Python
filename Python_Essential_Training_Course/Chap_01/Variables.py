# How computers are thinking?
# The computer is looking where a is stocked and where b is stocked and adds them to make c then stores it

# Why is it important how a computer thinks?

a_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b_2 = a_2

# In this example if we modify something in a_2, we modify it in b_2 as well as they have the same memory
